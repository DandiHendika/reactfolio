			   "I'm a programmer with interest and experience in two main fields: web development and game development. In web development, I'm proficient in various front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. On the other hand, I also have expertise in game development using Unity, with a focus on game programming and game design. With this flexible background, I'm accustomed to thinking both creatively and structurally—combining design aesthetics with technical functionality. My goal is to create digital solutions that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use. Currently, I'm open to collaborations and new opportunities in the digital technology field, both in web and game development.",
